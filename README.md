# Datasets-for-LLMs
Here's 1 example of other LLM training data I created while working as an Advanced AI Data Trainer on the programming & data science team to train a well known LLM. (All my original content so feel free to use anything that may be of value.)
In the generatefloormatdata file you will find the Python script I wrote to assist with creating a synthetic dataset that I could use in the spreadsheets needed to train an LLM on business and finance use cases. The 2nd file (AutoMats.ETH_dataset.xlsx click on "view raw") is the spreadsheet including visualizations I created with the synthetic dataset provided from the script. Please note that all errors- major and minor- in the spreadsheet are intentional and used to train the LLM via specific related prompts. This dataset was used in various rounds of training including helpfulness/harmfulness, induced hallucination attempts and general accuracy in analysis. 
**If you would like to use the script I made here to generate similar data you can adjust the columns, data points etc to your personal needs. If you are new to python and/or need any assistance in doing so, please feel free to reach out and I am happy to help.**
