# 🧠 LLM Training Dataset Example: Business & Finance Use Case

This repository contains a sample dataset I personally created while working as an **Advanced AI Data Trainer** on a programming and data science team. The project contributed to training a well-known large language model (LLM) for improved performance in business and finance tasks.

## 📁 Files Included

### `generatefloormatdata.py`
This is a custom Python script I developed to generate synthetic datasets for business and finance applications. It was designed to populate spreadsheets with structured data that could be used to:
- Simulate real-world financial scenarios
- Train LLMs on pattern recognition, error handling, and analytical tasks
- Support controlled experimentation in prompt-based fine-tuning

### `AutoMats.ETH_dataset.xlsx`
This spreadsheet contains:
- Synthetic financial data generated by the script
- Built-in visualizations
- **Intentional errors** (both minor and major) to train the model on:
  - Detecting inaccuracies
  - Handling hallucinations
  - Providing helpful and context-aware analysis
  - Scoring for helpfulness vs. harmfulness

> ⚠️ **Note:** Every error in the spreadsheet is intentional and designed to improve model robustness during prompt-based training rounds.

## 🛠️ Use & Customization

You can easily adapt the Python script to your own needs by modifying:
- Column names
- Data formats
- Generation logic

If you're new to Python or need help customizing it, feel free to reach out — I’m happy to assist!
